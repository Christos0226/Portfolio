# Portfolio
Holds all the projects I made in my computational physics class


# What you will need to run the code in each project:

## Project 1: Plinko

For the plinko project you will need vpython, matplotlib, numpy, and random.

## Project 2: Enzyme kinetics

For the Enzyme project you will need vpython, a file called ode.py which will be given in the enzyme folder, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Project 3: Max angle

For the Max angle project you will need ode.py which is a python file that will be in the Max folder, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Project 4 Oscillator: 

For the Oscillator project you will need numpy, matplotlib, scipy,linalg, pandas, and scipy.optimize

## Project 5 Circuit:

For this project you will need numpy and numpy.linalg


# Description:

## Project 1: Plinko

This project answers the question: Does the change in the radius effect the time it takes for a ball to go trough a plinko machine.

## Project 2: Enzyme kinetics

This project Looks into the reaction rates of enzyms, substrates, and complexes. Using ode's to take away numerical error.

## Project 3: Max angle

This project finds the angle to hit a baseball and make it reach its farthest distance.

## Project 4: Oscillator

This project Answers the questions:

1,) Does changing the number of masses ùëÅ affect the fundamental frequency 

2.) Does changing the effective stiffness ùêæ affect the fundamental frequency?

3.) Does changing the total mass ùëÄ affect the fundamental frequency?

## Project 5: Circuit

This project finds the voltage current in a set of nodes and voltage sources in a circuit. The circuit onlu contains passive elemetns.
